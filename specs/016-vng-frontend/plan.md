# Implementation Plan: VNG Kenniscentrum Innovatie Frontend

**Branch**: `016-vng-frontend` | **Date**: 2026-06-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/016-vng-frontend/spec.md`

## Summary

Add a second, deliberately simpler frontend ("VNG frontend", for **VNG Kenniscentrum Innovatie**) that runs alongside the existing Explorer frontend, served as a sibling subdomain against the **same BFF** and sharing the **same `ea_session`** authentication. The VNG app has three tabs — **Graph** (network over the Netherlands map), **Space details**, **Dashboard** (recharts bar charts: counts by NDS category and VNG-2030 theme) — driven by a **selected-space set** = (active innovation hub's spaces) ∪ (direct additions) − removals.

The BFF gains additive, typed-SDK capabilities: **innovation-hub listing/resolution**, **gemeentedelers Knowledge-Base callout fetching** for the optional **"include GemeenteDelers initiatives"** layer, and **server-side category counting** for the dashboard. Because GD initiatives encode their gemeente/theme links **only as Callout tag strings**, the server resolves those tags against a **build-time snapshot registry** generated from the `vng-gemeente-delers` repo (municipality display-name → `gemeente-<name>` org nameID; theme label → theme node). The same snapshot identifies the ~342 gemeente organisations for the **show/hide gemeentes** toggle. Localisation (Dutch default + English) and configuration (default hub, gemeentedelers space nameID, tag→category mapping, long GD cache TTL) round out the work.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (strict, ESM), Node 24 (server), React 19 (frontends)
**Primary Dependencies**: Server — Express 5, `openid-client` v6, `graphql-request` + codegen SDK, `better-sqlite3`. Frontend(s) — React 19, Vite 7, react-router 7, D3 v7 (graph/map), Radix UI + Tailwind v4 + CVA/clsx/tailwind-merge + lucide-react (shadcn-style). **New**: `recharts` (dashboard charts, via shadcn `ui/chart.tsx`), `i18next` + `react-i18next` (VNG app localisation).
**Storage**: Existing SQLite cache (`better-sqlite3`, WAL). Reuses `cache_entries (user_id, space_id)`; adds a long-TTL GD-layer entry per user (`space_id = "__gd_initiatives__"`). No schema change required (TTL carried in existing `expires_at`).
**Testing**: Vitest (server + each frontend); Playwright visual regression (root). New unit tests for hub resolution, GD tag→node resolution, category counting; new visual snapshots for the VNG app.
**Target Platform**: Linux server container; modern browsers. Two frontends served as sibling subdomains in production; two dev servers locally.
**Project Type**: Web application — one BFF + two SPA frontends sharing code via a pnpm workspace.
**Performance Goals**: First VNG load (default hub ≤30 spaces) graph+map ≤5s (SC-002); hub switch / selection change ≤3–5s (SC-003/004); org→connected-spaces reveal <1s (SC-012). GD layer fetch amortised by ~1-week cache (FR-046).
**Constraints**: Frontend talks only to BFF (Principle III); typed SDK only (Principle II); per-user/per-space cache scoping, no token logging (Principle IV); graceful degradation (Principle V). VNG app must be measurably simpler than Explorer (SC-009).
**Scale/Scope**: ~342 gemeente orgs, 92 themes, ~305 GD initiatives; hubs ≤ a few dozen spaces typical; one new SPA (~3 tabs) + ~3 new BFF endpoints + 2–3 new GraphQL queries.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **I. Alkemio OIDC auth (PKCE via BFF)** | ✅ Pass | VNG app reuses the existing `ea_session` flow; no new auth UI, no credentials. Cookie scoped to shared parent domain; VNG origin added to `SESSION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Browser still holds only the opaque session cookie. |
| **II. Typed GraphQL contract** | ✅ Pass | New innovation-hub and gemeentedelers-callout queries are added as `.graphql` files and consumed via the codegen SDK; `pnpm run codegen` re-run. No raw query strings. |
| **III. BFF boundary** | ✅ Pass | VNG frontend calls only the BFF (`/api/*`, `credentials: 'include'`). Hub listing, GD callouts, dashboard counts, gemeente identity all resolved server-side. |
| **IV. Data sensitivity** | ✅ Pass | GD-layer cache stays **per-user** (longer TTL only); access verified at read time (user must have READ on the gemeentedelers space). No token logging. Snapshot registry contains only public municipality/theme reference data. Parameterised SQL unchanged. |
| **V. Graceful degradation** | ✅ Pass | Empty hub, unreadable gemeentedelers space, unresolved initiative tags, missing translations, missing category data all have defined non-fatal fallbacks (FR-017/024/044/043, edge cases). |
| **VI. Design fidelity** | ⚠️ Advisory | The VNG app is a **new** experience not covered by the 001 design brief; it adopts the shadcn/Tailwind token system already in use and VNG branding. No conflict with the Explorer's brief (Explorer is unchanged). Recorded in Complexity Tracking. |

**Gate result**: PASS (no unjustified violations). The one advisory (VI) is inherent to introducing a new, separately-branded surface and is tracked below.

### Source Code (repository root)

Adopt a **pnpm workspace** so the apps share code and a single deduped `node_modules`. All frontend code lives under one **`frontend/`** parent with three sibling packages — **`shared`**, **`ecosystem-analytics`** (the existing Explorer, moved in), and **`vng`** (new). The server is unchanged structurally.

```

**Structure Decision**: Introduce a pnpm workspace (`packages: server, frontend/*`) and consolidate all frontend code under one **`frontend/`** parent: `frontend/shared` (the extracted `@ea/shared` lib — graph, map, details, api/auth services, shadcn primitives, tokens), `frontend/ecosystem-analytics` (the existing Explorer, **moved** from the old top-level `frontend/`), and `frontend/vng` (the new app). Both apps consume `@ea/shared`, honouring "share a lot of its architecture" without cross-app source imports, keeping React/deps deduped, and leaving the Explorer behaviourally unchanged. The server stays a single BFF; all new capability is additive.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation / Deviation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `frontend/{shared,ecosystem-analytics,vng}` + pnpm workspace (3 packages); the existing Explorer is **moved** into `frontend/ecosystem-analytics` | Two apps must share graph/map/details/services without duplication; workspace dedupes React and deps; one `frontend/` parent keeps the surfaces together | Cross-importing one app's `src` from another risks duplicate React instances and couples builds; copy-paste would fork the graph engine |
| New surface not in the 001 design brief (Principle VI advisory) | VNG is a distinct, separately-branded audience experience | Reusing the Explorer UI verbatim contradicts the explicit "much simpler" + VNG-branding requirements |
| Build-time snapshot registry committed into the server | GD themes/gemeentes survive into Alkemio only as flat tag strings; structured links exist only in the `vng-gemeente-delers` vault | Live cross-repo read at runtime couples deployments; deriving solely from the `gemeente` keyword can't recover theme links or municipality→nameID mapping |
| Per-user GD cache with a separate long TTL | Constitution IV requires per-user/per-space scoping; GD corpus is archival so a 1-week TTL avoids refetch | A shared global GD cache would violate per-user scoping; the standard 24h TTL would refetch 305 callouts needlessly |

## Phase notes

- **Phase 0 (research.md)**: resolves the serving/cookie topology, the shared-package extraction boundary, the GD tag-resolution algorithm, node/edge modelling for INITIATIVE/THEME, cache strategy, charting + i18n library choices, and the snapshot generation approach.
- **Phase 1 (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)**: new node/edge types and registry/config schemas; BFF endpoint contracts (`/api/hubs*`, `/api/graph/generate` extension, `/api/vng/dashboard`); the snapshot file contract + generator; dev/run instructions.
- **Phase 2 (/speckit.tasks)**: NOT produced here.
